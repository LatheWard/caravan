# Caravan  
*A trading site for keyboard enthusiasts.*

> Merriam-Webster defines a **caravan** as “a company of travelers on a journey through desert or hostile regions.”  

Whether you’re buying your first mechanical keyboard or adding board #100 to your collection, **Caravan** aims to make buying and selling pre-built keyboards as easy as buying a new or used guitar.  

Heavily inspired by [Reverb](https://reverb.com/), **Caravan** seeks to capture that same
sense of trusted, no non-sense trading — but for mechanical keyboards.
